# Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project. In there, you might find the `_reset.scss`, or whatever, probably some stuff dealing with `_typography.scss` rules, and, depending on the project, maybe some other files (like `_base.scss`).

- `_index.scss`
- `_root.scss`
- `_reset.scss`
- `_base.scss`
- `_fonts.scss`
- `_typography.scss`
- `_helpers.scss`
