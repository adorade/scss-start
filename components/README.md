# Components

For smaller components, there is the `components/` folder (frequently called `modules/`). While `layout/` is kind of **macro** (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more **micro**. It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in `components/` since your site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

- `_index.scss`
– `_buttons.scss`
– `_carousel.scss`
– `_cover.scss`
– `_dropdown.scss`
- `_media.scss`

*The `components/` folder is frequently called `modules/`, depending on what you prefer.*
